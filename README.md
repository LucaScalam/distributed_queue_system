Distributed Queue System - System Programming

This system is a classical scheme used in clusters. 

There is a main server which is in charge of the management of the queues. Clients can submit jobs, interactive and not interactive ones. On the other side, Execution Servers can also connect to the main and ask for jobs to be executed. In case of interactive jobs, a socket is created hence exec_server can communicate directly with client.
